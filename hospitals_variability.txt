Top 10 Procedures with Greatest Variability:
1. ED1
2. ED2
3. OP 18
4. Median Time to Transfer to Another Facility for Acute Coronary Intervention
5. Door to Diagnostic evaluation
6. Median time to receive pain medication
7. Endoscopy/Polyp Surveillance: Appropriate Follow-Up Interval
8. Endoscopy/Polyp Surveillance: Colonoscopy Interval 
9. Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis
10. Immunization for influenza


Explanation of Method:
The scores of each procedure were aggregated and the variance was taken. The procedures in this list represent procedures that are handled with high variability from hospital to hospital. ED stands for Emergency Department, but it is unclear specifically what kinds of procedures this might include and what the difference between ED1 and ED2 is. OP18 is “Operation 18” though it is unclear specifically what procedure this refers to. Overall this strategy for obtaining the variance of a procedure from hospital to hospital seems reasonable logical (i.e. procedures of the emergency department would presumably vary dramatically depending on the hospital).
