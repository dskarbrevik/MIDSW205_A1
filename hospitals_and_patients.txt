Explanation of Method:
By aggregating scores for different questions on patient surveys we have a cumulative score for each hospital (max of 15). One issue is that more than 10 hospitals scored a perfect 15. Also, though I did not do so, it would have been good to consider only hospitals with at least X amount of responses so that hospitals that may have a small sample size don’t rank high simply due to chance. Looking at a comparison of the top 10 survey results and top 10 hospitals (scored by procedure proficiency) it would seem that there is no overlap between the two lists. However if we were to include more than 10 results from the survey query, we would see that several hospitals from the top 10 hospitals actually scored a perfect 15 as well.
